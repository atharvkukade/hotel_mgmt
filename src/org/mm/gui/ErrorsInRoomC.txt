-Error giving for if check in date selected as current date
-Wrong output for check in and checj out date 
	For duplicate entry for same roomNo in RoomDates it consider as seperate selection
-executeUpdate() used for insert , update ,delete whose ResultSet returns nothing..
-SQL query select TableName(Atrr1 , Atrr2 )values(?,?);
-check appropriate PreparedStatement used for appropriate query
-Do not use rs.getSomething after rs.close()
-No.s used for rs.setSomething are not related to mysql column nos they are related to query
-SimpleDateFormat smf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd") ;
	used to set date in sql query to util.Date object
-ResultSet cursor initially set to before first record always use rs.next() to fetch first record.
-Before successfully saving data of guest before that RoomDate entry updated
	--Sol :After successfully  execution of GuestDetails frame values inserted in RoomDate table and after roomDateID updated in GuestDetails roomDate Id Field.
-You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'where phoneNo='7575757575'' at line 1
	
-Updates Req..
1.Check last entry of RoomDaates
2.Mandate user to enter all fields of GuestDetails
	if(!textFiledReference.getText().isEmpty())

-if(checkInDate.before(new Date())
returns false for current date bcoz current date is set to milli sec precision and our compilation time also taken into account by before() and hence
It is time interval between creation new Date() and checking of before method with current tomestamp of new milli sec precision
---Solution:-Setting Date object to yyyy-MM-dd precision
					SimpleDateFormat smf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd") ;
					Date formattedCheckInDate = smf.parse(smf.format(checkInDate)) ;
					Date formattedCurrentDate = smf.parse(smf.format(new Date())) ;
-Error:Table 'HotelBilling.ROOM' doesn't exist
